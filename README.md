# -EM-Wave-Behaviour-Digital-Twin
This project explores the concept of electromagnetic (EM) wave propagation in a virtual environment using Unity's raycast functionality. 
The project focuses on simulating real-world EM wave behavior, including attenuation and fading effects.
By implementing attenuation and fading, the project aims to provide a more realistic representation of EM wave propagation, particularly in free space. The attenuation factor accounts for the decrease in signal strength as the waves travel through space, while fading introduces random fluctuations to simulate signal variations caused by interference, obstacles, or other environmental factors.

##Key Features
EM wave propagation simulation using Unity's raycast functionality
Calculation and visualization of attenuation effects on signal strength
Implementation of fading effects to simulate signal variations
Real-time visualization of signal strength and fading levels
Adjustable parameters to control attenuation and fading behavior
Interactive environment to observe the effects of different scenarios

##Requirements
Unity 2018 or later
